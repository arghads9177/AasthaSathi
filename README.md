## 🧭 Project Overview

When an employee asks:

> “What is the withdrawal policy for the Monthly Deposit Scheme of member 2045?”

2. **Fetches** the live member’s scheme details from the core banking REST API (via MCP).  
3. **Synthesizes** a combined answer — citing both the policy clause and live data.  
4. **Responds** naturally, in a secure, auditable manner.
